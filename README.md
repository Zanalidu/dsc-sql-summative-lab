Conclusions for PART 2

Several genres show an increase in rating in the second half of the decade 
analyzed. However, the most drastic increases look to be in the categories 
of Horror and Sci-Fi. Horror seems to also show a trend up in number of 
movies, where Sci-Fi holds about level as the lowest of the categories listed.

Further analysis might be warranted to see if this increase in user rating 
and low quantity of movies signifies a possible underserved group. The 
continued analysis would need to focus on whether this increase in average 
rating is an artifact of the data or if it shows a genuine increase interest 
in the genre. Another avenue of further inquiry would be into the writers and 
director that are producing work in this genre, particularly among 
mass-market movies (those with a large number of user ratings).

Before further analysis can be done, it would be important that the involved 
columns are cleaned. The main focus would be on the genre category. The 
preliminary look at unique genre types showed many variations and multiple 
categories per movie. This was handled in the initial analysis by looking for 
anything containing the key word(s) of each genre, but a more robust 
standardization would be required to have a higher degree of certainty in 
the accuracy of the results.
